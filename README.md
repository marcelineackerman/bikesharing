## Purpose and Overview

In order to convince an angel investor to fund a similar project in Des Moines, Iowa, this project was created using existing data from Citibike in New York City, NY. Data specifically from August was chosen due to the warm weather, which likely encouraged users to utilize Citibike more often. Using Tableau, a number of visualizations of the data were created, and made into a story to properly convey the plan of how we can make this a success in Iowa like it is in NYC.

## Results

### Checkout Times for Users

This line graph demonstrates the length of time users generally checkout Citibike bikes. As shown, trips are nearly always within one hour.

### Checkout Times by Gender

When broken out by gender, the trip times remain generally the same. Males are more likely to have longer trips, but no gender often breaks the one-hour mark.

### Trips by Weekday per Hour

On weekdays, the bikes are checked out around standard business commute hours, around 8am and 5pm, while weekends have a more evenly distributed usage rate. This may indicate Citibikes are most often checked out by residents or frequent travelers on business trips.

### Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)

When accounting for gender, the general checkout times remain the same, with highest usage around commute hours on weekdays, and more distributed usage on weekends.

### Trips by Gender by Weekday

Male users continue to be the highest rate of users, but as demonstrated here, subscribers are much higher in number than one-time use customers. This heatmap also reinforces weekday use outnumbering weekend use, further supporting that our userbase should focus on residents or frequent business travelers.

### Peak Hours in August

The hours surrounding our highest checkout times, 8am and 5pm, are also higher than the rest of the day. This variation is likely due to variance in workday start and end times, but does not detract from our earlier focus on commuting users.

### Customers

Citibike customers are roughly 77% long-term subscribers rather than one-time customers, which indicates repeat users, likely, again, for commuting or business trip purposes.

## Summary

### Conclusions

In order to maximize success, a Citibike-esque venture in Des Moines, Iowa should focus on marketing to frequent business-focused travelers, as well as inner-city residents. The data supports this focus, as a large amount of custom comes from long-term subscribers who checkout bikes around 8am and 5pm, indicating commuters. We cannot completely ignore tourists and one-time customers, but the large portion of our revenue will come from repeat, longterm customers. 

This brings up other concerns, like ensuring a steady and reliable supply of working bikes in the same places around the city each day, so commuters do not have to guess if they will have a ride available for their commute. Maintenance will also be impacted-- it should be performed in the very early morning or late night, in order to not disrupt the large portion of our eventual customer base.

Further visualizations that could be useful in this are:
 - A map plot analysis of bike usage by station location, to determine what locations see the most frequent usage and thus require the most frequent maintenance.
 - An area plot analysis of average trip duration by station location, to determine where we will need the most bikes stationed to meet a steady and consistent supply for consistent customer use.

Using this data, we hope to support and plan a venture in bringing a bikesharing company to Des Moines, Iowa that is just as or even more successful than NYC's Citibike.
